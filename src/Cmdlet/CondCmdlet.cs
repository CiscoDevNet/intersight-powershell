The server will be re-evaluated once HCL data service is back online or finished importing new HCL data.\n* `Service-Error` - The validation has failed because the HCL data service has returned a service error or unrecognized result.\n* `Not-Evaluated` - This means the HclStatus for the sever has not been evaluated because it is exempted.\n* `Incompatible-Components` - The validation has failed for this server because one or more components have \"Not-Listed\" status.\n* `Compatible` - The validation has passed for this server's model, processor, OS vendor and version."</para>

The status can be one of the following \"Incomplete\" - there is no enough information to evaluate against the HCL data \"Validated\" - all components have been evaluated against the HCL and they all have \"Validated\" status \"Not-Listed\" - all components have been evaluated against the HCL and one or more have \"Not-Listed\" status. \"Not-Evaluated\" - server is not evaluated against the HCL because it is exempted.\n* `Incomplete` - This means we do not have os information in Intersight for this server. Either install ucstools vib or use power shell scripts to tag proper OS information.\n* `Not-Found` - At HclStatus level, this means that one of the components has failed validation. At HclStatusDetail level, this means that his component's hardware or software profile was not found in the HCL.\n* `Not-Listed` - At the HclStatus level, this means that some part of the HCL validation has failed. This could be that either the server's hardware or software profile was not listed in the HCL or one of the components' hardware or software profile was not found in the HCL.\n* `Validated` - At the HclStatus level, this means that all of the components have passed validation. At HclStatusDetail level, this means that the component's hardware or software profile was found in the HCL.\n* `Not-Evaluated` - At the HclStatus level this means that this means that SW or Component status has not been evaluated as the previous evaluation step has not passed yet. At the HclStatusDetail level this means that either HW or SW status has not been evaluted because a previous evaluation step has not passed yet."</para>
