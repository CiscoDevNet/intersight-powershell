## DESCRIPTION

Initialize cmdlet is used to instantiate the object of complex type in the Powershell session, it does not create the object on the server.

## PARAMETERS

### -Account
A reference to a iamAccount resource.\nWhen the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

 Note:- To get the relationship object pass the MO to the cmdlet Get-IntersightMoMoRef 
or use the cmdlet Initialize-IntersightMoMoRef.

```yaml
Type: Model.IamAccountRelationship
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Action
The action of the workflow such as start, cancel, retry, pause.\n* `None` - No action is set, this is the default value for action field.\n* `Create` - Create a new instance of the workflow but it does not start the execution of the workflow. Use the Start action to start execution of the workflow.\n* `Start` - Start a new execution of the workflow.\n* `Pause` - Pause the workflow, this can only be issued on workflows that are in running state.\n* `Resume` - Resume the workflow which was previously paused through pause action on the workflow.\n* `Retry` - Retry the workflow that has previously reached a final state and has the retryable property set to true. A running or waiting workflow cannot be retried. If the property retryFromTaskName is also passed along with this action, the workflow will be started from that specific task, otherwise the workflow will be restarted from the first task.  The task name in retryFromTaskName must be one of the tasks that completed or failed in the previous run. It is not possible to retry a workflow from a task which wasn&apos;t run in the previous iteration.\n* `RetryFailed` - Retry the workflow that has failed. A running or waiting workflow or a workflow that completed successfully cannot be retried. Only the tasks that failed in the previous run will be retried and the rest of workflow will be run. This action does not restart the workflow and also does not support retrying from a specific task.\n* `Cancel` - Cancel the workflow that is in running or waiting state.
