# WorkflowWorkflowDefinitionRelationship
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "workflow.WorkflowDefinition"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "workflow.WorkflowDefinition"]
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Selector** | **String** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Link** | **String** | A URL to an instance of the &#39;mo.MoRef&#39; class. | [optional] 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DefaultVersion** | **Boolean** | When true this will be the workflow version that is used when a specific workflow definition version is not specified. The default version is used when user executes a workflow without specifying a version or when workflow is included in another workflow without a specific version. The very first workflow definition created with a name will be set as the default version, after that user can explicitly set any version of the workflow definition as the default version. | [optional] 
**Description** | **String** | The description for this workflow. | [optional] 
**InputDefinition** | [**WorkflowBaseDataType[]**](WorkflowBaseDataType.md) |  | [optional] 
**InputParameterSet** | [**WorkflowParameterSet[]**](WorkflowParameterSet.md) |  | [optional] 
**Label** | **String** | A user friendly short name to identify the workflow. Label can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), period (.), colon (:), space ( ) or an underscore (_). | [optional] 
**LicenseEntitlement** | **String** | License entitlement required to run this workflow. It is calculated based on the highest license requirement of all its tasks. * &#x60;Base&#x60; - Base as a License type. It is default license type. * &#x60;Essential&#x60; - Essential as a License type. * &#x60;Standard&#x60; - Standard as a License type. * &#x60;Advantage&#x60; - Advantage as a License type. * &#x60;Premier&#x60; - Premier as a License type. * &#x60;IWO-Essential&#x60; - IWO-Essential as a License type. * &#x60;IWO-Advantage&#x60; - IWO-Advantage as a License type. * &#x60;IWO-Premier&#x60; - IWO-Premier as a License type. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "Base"]
**MaxTaskCount** | **Int64** | The maximum number of tasks that can be executed on this workflow. | [optional] [readonly] 
**MaxWorkerTaskCount** | **Int64** | The maximum number of external (worker) tasks that can be executed on this workflow. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Name** | **String** | The name for this workflow. You can have multiple versions of the workflow with the same name. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), period (.) or an underscore (_). | [optional] 
**OutputDefinition** | [**WorkflowBaseDataType[]**](WorkflowBaseDataType.md) |  | [optional] 
**OutputParameters** | [**AnyType**](.md) | The output mappings for the workflow. The outputs for worflows will generally be task output variables that we want to export out at the end of the workflow. The format to specify the mapping is &#39;${Source.output.JsonPath}&#39;. &#39;Source&#39; is the name of the task within the workflow. You can map any task output to a workflow output as long as the types are compatible. Following this is JSON path expression to extract JSON fragment from source&#39;s output. | [optional] 
**Properties** | [**WorkflowWorkflowProperties**](WorkflowWorkflowProperties.md) |  | [optional] 
**Tasks** | [**WorkflowWorkflowTask[]**](WorkflowWorkflowTask.md) |  | [optional] 
**UiInputFilters** | [**WorkflowUiInputFilter[]**](WorkflowUiInputFilter.md) |  | [optional] 
**UiRenderingData** | [**AnyType**](.md) | This will hold the data needed for workflow to be rendered in the user interface. | [optional] 
**ValidationInformation** | [**WorkflowValidationInformation**](WorkflowValidationInformation.md) |  | [optional] 
**Version** | **Int64** | The version of the workflow to support multiple versions. | [optional] [default to 1]
**Catalog** | [**WorkflowCatalogRelationship**](WorkflowCatalogRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**WorkflowMetadata** | [**WorkflowWorkflowMetadataRelationship**](WorkflowWorkflowMetadataRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
