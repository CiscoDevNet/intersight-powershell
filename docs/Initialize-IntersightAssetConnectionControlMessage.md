## DESCRIPTION

Initialize cmdlet is used to instantiate the object of complex type in the Powershell session, it does not create the object on the server.

## PARAMETERS

### -Account
The account id to which the device belongs.

```yaml
Type: string
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AdditionalProperties


```yaml
Type: System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[string,object]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ClassId
The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.\nThis property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload\nwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.

```yaml
Type: AssetConnectionControlMessage.ClassIdEnum
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ConnectorVersion
The version of the device connector currently running on the platform. Deprecated by newer connectors that will report this directly to the device connector gateway in a websocket header, but included to continue to support older versions which report any version change after connect.

```yaml
Type: string
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DeviceId
The Moid of the device under change. Used to route the message to a device&apos;s connection.

```yaml
Type: string
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Evict
Flag to force any open connections to be evicted. Used in case device has been deleted or blacklisted.

```yaml
Type: bool
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Leadership
The current leadership of a device cluster member.\n* `Unknown` - The node is unable to complete election or determine the current state. If the device has been registered before and the node has access to the current credentials it will establish a connection to Intersight with limited capabilities that can be used to debug the HA failure from Intersight.\n* `Primary` - The node has been elected as the primary and will establish a connection to the Intersight service and accept all message types enabled for a primary node. There can only be one primary in a given cluster, while the underlying platform may be active-active only one connector will assume the primary role.\n* `Secondary` - The node has been elected as a secondary node in the cluster. The device connector will establish a connection to the Intersight service with limited capabilities. e.g. file upload will be enabled, but requests to the underlying platform management will be disabled.

```yaml
Type: AssetConnectionControlMessage.LeadershipEnum
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NewIdentity
The new identity assigned to a device on ownership change (claim/unclaim).

```yaml
Type: string
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ObjectType
The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.\nThe value should be the same as the &apos;ClassId&apos; property.

```yaml
Type: AssetConnectionControlMessage.ObjectTypeEnum
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Partition
The partition the device was last connected to, used to address the control message to the device connector gateway instance holding the devices connection.

```yaml
Type: long
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Json
Returns the json payload received in response.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WithHttpInfo
Returns the HTTP response with headers and content.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: false
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
